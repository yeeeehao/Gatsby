## 🌌 Conclusion and Reflection
This web can realize most functions (select major, add courses, display GPA, calculate GPA, draw line chart...), and can be put into basic use.
But there is no restriction on adding the same course (for example, I can add two same courses in the same semester), and there is no edit and delete function.
